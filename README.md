### 🌟 About Me

I'm a developer in training focused on **web-based projects**—bringing ideas to life on the internet is where I thrive. 
Currently, I’m honing my skills in **full-stack development**, especially with **React.js**, **Laravel**, and **PHP**. Most of my projects revolve around creating dynamic and scalable web applications.

On the side, I’ve ventured into **C# game development** using **Unity**, but my true passion lies in **web technologies** that shape the digital landscape.

### 🚀 What Gets Me Excited

- **Building user-centric web apps** that solve real-world problems.
- **Enhancing existing software**, refining it into cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Learning about memory address manipulation** using tools like **Cheat Engine**—not for hacking, but to understand 
  how memory works at a deeper level and how it affects software performance and optimization.
- **Experimenting with game mods**, which gives me a better grasp of how games work and how modifications can alter their behavior.
